Create an S3 Bucket
Option 1: Using the AWS Management Console
Login to the AWS Console.

Navigate to the S3 service.
Create Bucket.

Click on the “Create bucket” button.
Give your bucket a unique name (e.g., my-static-website-bucket) and select your region.

Uncheck the option Block all public access (since this is a public website).

Acknowledge the warning about public access.

Leave other settings as default and click Create bucket.

Upload HTML, CSS, and JS Files to the Bucket

Option 1: Using the AWS Console
Go to your bucket.
Click on the “Upload” button.
Add your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
Click Upload.


Enable Static Website Hosting in S3
Go to your bucket settings.

Under Properties, find Static website hosting.

Choose Enable and set the following:

Index Document: index.html (the entry point of your website).
Error Document: error.html (optional but useful).
Click Save changes.

Set an S3 Bucket Policy for Public Access
Since S3 buckets are private by default, we need to make the content accessible to the public.

Go to your bucket.
Click on the Permissions tab.
Scroll down to Bucket policy.
Add the following policy to make the content publicly accessible:


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}


Make sure to replace my-static-website-bucket with your actual bucket name.

Click Save.
Now your bucket content is publicly accessible.

Access Your Static Website
You can now access your static website using the S3 website URL. This URL is available in the Static website hosting section under the Properties tab of your bucket.
